# Next Stop Eastie: Using Machine Learning to Predict Socioeconomic Trends in Boston and Beyond
This repository is contains folders of scripts, datasets, and model outputs used in our study of socioeconomic change in Greater Boston. <br><br>
The scripts file contains a series of Jupyter notebooks used to clean ACS tables, perform PCA to create a neighborhood socioeconmic score for all 
census tracts in the dataset, perform predictive modeling to gain a sense of how socioeconomic change is occuring in Boston and surrounding communities,
and create visualizations of data distribution and modeling outputs. <br><br>
Additionally, this repository includes a detailed excel sheet containing all of the ACS tables and variables used in this analysis as well as a folder
of mapped changes in neighborhood socioeconomic scores. <br><br>
These Jupyter notebooks were adapted from the analysis performed by Reades et al. in their paper <i>Understanding urban gentrification through machine
learning</i>. The authors kindly made their scripts publicly available on GitHub. Their scripts can be found <a href="https://github.com/jreades/urb-studies-predicting-gentrification">here</a>.
